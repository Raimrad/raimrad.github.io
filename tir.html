                            say good wishes. For the eastern peoples, Nauryz is the same as the New Year, because both

                        <h5>Kyz kuumai (catch up with the girl) is a national equestrian game in Kazakhstan and
                            Kyrgyzstan. It involves boys and girls who compete in pairs on horses of half-bred breeds.
                            In the first half of the game, a young man chases a girl and if he catches up, he kisses
                            her; in the second half of the game they switch places. The girl strives to catch up with
                            her partner and, if successful, hits him with a whip. The race distance is 400-500 m. At the
                            end of the distance, a flag is installed indicating the turning control point. The girl
                            takes the start two horses ahead.

                            The skill of the game (for individual or team championship) is assessed on a five-point
                            system, taking into account three criteria - the art of horsemanship, the artistry (beauty)
                            of the performance and the agility of the race. Participants perform in colorful national
                            costumes on horses of the same suit, spectacular in appearance, thanks to which the
                            spectacular side of the competition greatly benefits.</h5>

                            youth of the village, boys and girls, build an “altybakan” behind the village (alty - six,
                            bakan - a tall log). The game is of great importance in understanding art, the views of
                            young people, and their relationships. Parents look at various entertainments of young
                            people with indignation, and they do not have the right not to let go of “altybakan”
                            (especially girls). Here young people sing songs, play various games, and this fun continues
                            until midnight. “Altybakan” is a kind of entertaining leisure activity.</h5>

                            field. At a distance of 10-20 meters, the carcass of a ram was thrown at the competitors.
                            Thus began the struggle for kokpar, which could last until the evening.</h5>

                            lead. And among the khan’s and sultan’s children, the “saka” was even filled with gold.</h5>
